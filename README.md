# 🌌 Cosmic Life Mapper – Landing Page 🚀

This repository contains the **landing page** for **Cosmic Life Mapper** – an interactive web application that explores the habitability of exoplanets discovered by NASA, presented through stunning design and powerful insights.

## 🪐 What is Cosmic Life Mapper?

Cosmic Life Mapper is a data-driven platform that brings the universe a little closer to home. It uses real exoplanet data — nearly **5900 planets** discovered by NASA and archived by **Caltech** — to:

- 💫 Showcase detailed data on exoplanets located **light-years away**
- 🌍 Compare planets based on **habitability scores**
- 🔬 Visualize key components like:
  - Oxygen (O₂)
  - Methane (CH₄)
  - Carbon dioxide (CO₂)
  - Climate conditions
  - Terrain type
  - Mass, distance, and more

It’s an attempt to ask: *If Earth isn’t the only one, which other planets might host life?*

### 🔧 Build Your Own Planet

Just for fun (and science), users can create **custom exoplanets**:

- Choose your own terrain, atmospheric components, and conditions
- Name your planet
- Save it privately to your account
- This is an experimental feature but offers a playful way to learn
